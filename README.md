# LRMI profile

A schema.org/LRMI-based profile for describing OER. For now, the main purpose is
to have a schema to be used with [SkoHub Editor](https://github.com/hbz/skohub-editor).
See the web form at https://skohub.io/editor/?schema=https://dini-ag-kim.github.io/lrmi-profile/draft/schemas/schema.json 
for the current status.

The profile might be published as a HTML spec in the future.
